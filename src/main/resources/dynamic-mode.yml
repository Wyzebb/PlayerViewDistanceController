#  Min and max values dynamic mode will set a player's view distance to (must be within the boundaries in config.yml)
min: 2
max: 32

interval: 1200  # (ticks)

# MSPT is checked every interval and view distance is optimised as follows:
# All players have their view distance reduced by the chunks specified from their max allowed view distance
# Permission node 'pvdc.dynamic-mode-bypass' bypasses this.
